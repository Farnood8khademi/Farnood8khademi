- My name is Farnood Khademi
I graduated from the American University of Dubai in Business Administration and after graduating I worked as a Marketing Manager at ABE Middle East FZCO 
founded by my father Dr. Fariborz Khademi in the UAE.
I became more familiar with sales strategies and I consulted with reputable experts in this field so that I could be effective in the future of this industry .
In 2019, I came to Iran with my father's advice to join the main company, which was also founded by my father in 1991, 
to gain more experience. We were able to set up an education system in Nahrab to improve the level of staff and our agencies, 
To provide useful services to the community and the water industry . 
In this way, my father's experiences helped me a lot to gain technical and commercial information to find my position today as the Deputy CEO of 
the Nehrab Gostar Eshtehard company to serve my community as a small member of this group.
Today, due to the development of the Internet and its uses, I entered the world of digital currency in 2019. 
I became more familiar with blockchain to have the right investment in future projects and work on a project in the future that we can provide 
services with our colleagues in the water industry, which will be more important than any need in the future.
